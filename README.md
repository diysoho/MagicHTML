MagicHTML
=========

An new way to write html / css, using php to parse and compile css first, building dynamic javascript codes, allowing you to code really faster.

Some stuff you can use on CSS's using MagicHTML
- All Less syntax
- Condicional structure (if,elif,else)
if $browser == 'IE' and $version <= 8:
  #header {width: 930px;}
  all css here
end
- Element Querys (Not even close to ready yet)

There's a lot of cool stuf, i'll write it here latter, when things be a little bit more done.

- Check elquery-test.html and css/preview.css to see the idea. 

TODO
PHP compiler, so we can write with the right syntax direct into css and php makes de js part.
